# WEB_Automation_for_College_Website
Web automation is the concept of letting software robots perform actions, tasks, and processes on a
web browser or web application. Using the concept of web automation and selenium web drivers, we
created software that automatically retrieves the study materials from college website as per userâ€™s
request.
Tool Used: Selenium is an open source and portable automated software testing tool for testing web
applications or to automate web browsers. It provides a single interface that writes test scripts in
programming.
